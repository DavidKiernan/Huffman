I'd like to be coding in C
In the Sun Computer lab in the shade
Stay up all night, program it right
In a Sun Computer lab in the shade
I'd ask my friends to program C
in the computer lab with me
I'd like to be coding in C
In a Sun Computer lab in the shade.

We've never done using the Sun
In our little hideaway making lots of fun.
banking our head until we're dead.
In a Sun Computer lab in the shade

We would code and hack around
because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be coding in C
In a Sun computer lab in the shade

We would shout and scream about
our codes that pile up on the dirty floor
(Pile up on the dirty floor)
Oh what joy for all programmer boys
Knowing file system's never be safe..
(file system's never be safe)

We would be coding to death you and me
No one there to help us about C
I'd like to be coding in C
In a Sun computer lab with you.
In a Sun computer lab with you.
In a Sun computer lab with you.
